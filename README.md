# React 44 – Controlled Input & Derived Data 🔁

Simple React app that demonstrates:
- controlled input
- state-driven rerender
- derived data (no extra state)
- real-world filtering pattern

## Concepts
- `useState` stores only user input
- component rerenders on state change
- filtered list is recalculated on each render
- no `useEffect` needed
